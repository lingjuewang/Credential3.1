#' #' Credentialing main function
#'
#' This is the main function for credentialing.
#'
#' @param peaktable1 the features from the first ratio dataset.
#' @param peaktable2 the features from the second ratio dataset.
#' @param ppm mass error tolerance for isotopologue searching and credentialed features searching.
#' @param rtwin retention time window for 1st round credentialing
#' @param rtcom retention time window for 2nd round credentialing
#' @param ratio1 ratio of designated 12C/13C ratio in the first peaktable, by default set to 1/1
#' @param ratio2 ratio of designated 12C/13C ratio in the first peaktable, by default set to 1/2
#' @param ratio_tol  a factor that controls the ratio range to pass the 1st round credentialing, The default value is 0.1.
#' @param ratios_tol a factor that controls the ratio range to pass the 2nd round credentialing, The default value is 0.1.
#' @param cd unit mass difference among isotopologues. by defalut is 13C-12C = 13.00335 - 12.
#' @param charges charge states of the ions to be considered when searching isotope pairs. The default value is 1:2.
#' @param mpc A range of mass per carbon to be considered when searching possible isotope pairs and identifying U12C and U13C isotope peaks. The default value is c(12,120)
#' @param maxnmer maximum number of ion aggregation to be considered, The default value is 4.
#' @keywords credentialing
#' @import data.table
#' @return A list of the credentialed features before and after 1st and 2nd round filtering by the function.
