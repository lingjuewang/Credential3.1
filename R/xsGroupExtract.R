#' Extract peak-table from an xcmsSet object
#'
#'@param xs a xcmsSet object
#'@param intchoice the intensity options provided by xcms. Options: "into"(default) -raw peak area, "intb" -baseline corrected peak area, "maxo" - peak height
#'@param sampling the way to sampling intensity in each feature group. If 1, sampling mean intensities of all peaks. If 2, sampling the maximum intensity among all peaks.
#'@import data.table

#'@return a list includes two data.tables. featuretable is the detailed featuretable. credTable is the simplified format credentialing accepts in the next step.
